# **Netblend Social Site!**

---

Netblend is a social media website where the inter**NET** and coffee beans (that get **BLEND**ed together to make drinkable goodness), merge to one! Users are able to share photos of their best looking coffee's, create articles and set up events to meet with other coffee fanatics!

- The repository for the DRF-API that is linked to this project can be found [HERE](https://github.com/DSP1994/NetBlend_API). This will come with its own Readme file, so please head over there to have a read of that. Thank you.

### **Typography**

All fonts for this project were taken from the Google Fonts Library;

### **Imagery**

The imagery used for the [Not Found Page](#not-found-page), in the [Add Photos](#add-photos) section and in the [Sign Up/In](#sign-inoutup), were taken from Pinterest. Unfortunately I have lost the author, but I'm not sure they were the ones who took the photo, so not sure who best to give credit too!

## **Future Features**
With more experience and understanding of react there are a number of features I'd love to add in the future, including the following;
 - A confirmation warning if a user is about to delete something.
 - The ability to expand a profile picture to see the full thing.
 - Allowing users to share their posts to other social media sites via a share button.
 - Comments on articles and events would be amazing.
 - Notifications to the users phone or email when someone else interacts with *anything* that they have posted.
 - Most importantly, **block** certain users, to allow users the freedom to hide their pages from who they wish.
---

## **Manual Testing**
1. CRUD functionality has been tested for each of the following: Posts | Articles | Events | Comments | Likes | Follow | Profile
 - Likes & Follow may only be created & deleted
 - Profile may only be updated
2. Navigation links open to the correct pages.
3. Pages intended for logged-in users only will send logged-out users back to the home page.
4. Users trying to edit content that they did not publish are sent back to the home page.
6. Users are able to create a new account.
7. Users with an existing account are able to log in.
8. Each user has the ability to log out.
